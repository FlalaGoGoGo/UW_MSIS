B000FQ9R4E,AHTPTPEIW7D7VRJQ2A5DL4ROSZNQ,Another Look back,5,29-Jun-16,"This game is fun! I got after playing Smash 4 and Melee so it took a little time to adjust to the physics and speed but after that it felt like 4. The best part of this game is the characters, my personal favorite being Wolf O'Donnel from StarFox because he fits ny playstyle. There is also a story mode known as the Subspace emissary. I enjoy seeing teams of Nintendo characters and unlikely alliances but the universe of the SSE was bland, none of the characters talk but a couple of them use few words. So the story was hard to follow. The stages in Brawl mode are good, they brought back a plethora of stages from Melee. Most of them have to be unlocked though. This game has tons of unlockables it will take a while to get them all. The game is most fun with 4 friends like all Smash Bros. games although doing 1v1,s is fun like every smash game. This is the best game to start with to get good at Smash in my opinion so give it a shot you won't be dissapointed."

Although I will say, that Link's jumping ability is worse in this game comparatively. I was able to get this for cheaper than at Walmart so that was great. You should play this game."
B000FQ9R4E,AFVCOBOH4H7GCBEFZ6TGZFQPHBFQ,The game of all games.,5,28-Dec-16,"This game is hilarious. It is a fighting game, either between players or against the computer. The characters are ALL the characters - there are Mario characters, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, and many more I don't even know, all who battle each other. The characters retain some of their original moves and skills, but also pick up bonus items from ALL the games. For example, Princess Peach always carries a mushroom with her but also can pick up and use a Pokeball or a light saber. It is really funny and full of endless matches to keep your kids or the kid in you entertained for ages. The supplier promptly delivered the product as expected."

It would not load at all and the Wii did not recognize the disc. Imagine a 7 year old being SO excited to get this game from Santa only to have it not work. There should be a money back guarantee if the game is faulty."

B000FQ9R4E,AGOZLOEGZZ5NBJD7NIIZJCYE3IUQ,Nintendo: Basic but Still the Best,5,10-Feb-18,Love the game. Really nostalgic for me since growing up I had a Nintendo 64. Now my little brother really enjoys it. sometimes the most simple of formulas for a game is all a child needs. He prefers this game over the XBOX and all the games he has on that. It is a great gift idea for someone who has a young child who does not really understand the concept of the biggest and newest game system. Him and I love this game and we are about 15 years apart. It bridges the gap a bit and we both can play this game and have a lot of fun.
B000FQ9R4E,AEO4ZHEHDNQYEPGG5HEPUECOL72A,No booklet,3,16-Feb-18,It didn’t come with a manual. It didn’t say anything about not having the book when I ordered it. Otherwise I am sure the game is fine.

One of the characters is a little boy that keeps saying “I can murder” ok, I guess that’s why it’s a teen rating. I just didn’t think a Mario game would be like that. Don’t let the Mario brand fool you like it did me. This is def a teen game."

B000FQ9R4E,AFLIWTXSSZ6PWQRDUP4DJYPFOGDQ,Decent fighting game,4,9-May-18,My son had wanted this game for some time.  After we got it he played it once then lost interest.  I have to admit I was expecting a little more from this game but overall it did seem like a decent fighting game.  There are lots of different characters from other popular games to choose from and the game play seemed straight forward.

I tried it too and it is so fun.Also you can still get the extra characters by playing battle mode and not having to go through the single player story which is good for me.  I can let them play while i cook or work and dont have to come over every 10 minutes to help them beat the bosses on single player.  I do that when they go to sleep :)Must have for the wii"
B000FQ9R4E,AG6PQSUDTPN6EETEZJ2GH3NYEOLQ,Glitch in the game - stopped working.,1,29-May-18,"The game is good, but there is something wrong with it. We played to the ruins and can't get through the door. It has a bug or glitch. My son is devastated."

B000FQ9R4E,AGFPQDXNJQJ3UTBZGM2RYTDJQFRQ,Wrong region,1,12-Jun-18,"I received a Malaysia region disc, so I knew it wouldn't work at all. But also the fact that I had 2 other copies of this game from eBay thay ended up not reading, and I thought it was the discs but it was really my Wii Lens."

B000FQ9R4E,AETXY6TC3HYFPBGA3SRKFECFSYYQ,So much fun,5,4-Jul-18,Love the Subspace Emissary mode. You can play solo or local co-op. Playing with others is where this game really shines. To this day you can still play with people around the world online via the Wiimmfi servers after the Nintendo WFC shutdown in 2014. You used to need a modded Wii to do that. But not anymore. A quick Google search will show that in 2018 there are very simple ways to start playing games like Super Smash Bros Brawl online again. This game definitely still worth buying for that reason.
B000FQ9R4E,AFHEXEUJ3R6Q5OK6IJMW4E34H6IA,Waste of money.,1,16-Jul-18,Sent me a Saudi version of the game (brawl) dosent work on my US Wii.

The 3D effect is pretty awesome and eyecatching.  Sharp colors, great animation, and brings me back to my childhood when I played Super Mario on the NES Nintendo."

B002I092MM,AF4RWPZQ76HFQFHPE2IRLJDWDDTQ,"It's worth playing, but I probably wouldn't buy it.",3,28-Mar-16,"The game is ok. It has a lot of throw backs to old super Mario games, and it was cool to see those in a 3D environment, but the levels are short, easy, and don't have a whole lot of exploration to do.It's worth playing, but I probably wouldn't buy it."
B002I092MM,AHDDR6CK34WXCZZHXYRB6Q4FHY3Q,Fun,5,31-Mar-16,"Love this game, was a quick easy game to beat though. Have replayed it a couple times."

B002I092MM,AGXGROSKVP3PVAUNKNCEM4SYXDGQ,Not my cup of tea.,3,25-Apr-16,"I enjoy side strollers like new Super Mario Bros. This tries to be a side scroller while throwing 3d movement in there just to use the 3ds 3d feature. Not a fan. Instead of a sidescroller with cool 3d movement, it feels like a 3d game with terrible restrictions and small levels."
B002I092MM,AHEQKN7D2A6VMDMA2NWRVKKBYCKQ,Fun in the beginning but just ok after I completed ...,3,10-May-16,Fun in the beginning but just ok after I completed it. I felt it was overrated. I liked Luigi's Mansion much better. It could be because I've played just about every Super Mario that comes out and the concept is just getting dull to me. I didn't really care for Super Mario 3d World either.
B002I092MM,AHSQII3ZU4STQU7Z3A4QCT2NBO3Q,Five Stars,5,24-May-16,Always love Mario and this one does not disappoint.  Everything and more.

B002I092MM,AETQVRTOC272IMR52TMHGO43SLBA,A bit disappointed,3,26-May-16,"The game is kind of fun! I was expecting it to be way better especially given the fact that it is the first super mario in 3D.The game I bought was a used one described as being in a very good condition. BUT IT WASN'T. I was very disappointed, the game and the box were very dirty. The game is playable but since I am a collector, I was looking for a clean artcover and game cartridge which is not what I got."
B002I092MM,AH4RG7TKYKFUWE2665OKO5OWJWBQ,Mario never gets old,5,30-May-16,"Being an avid fan of the Mario series especially Super Mario Bros. 3 for NES, Super Mario Land 2 for Gameboy, Super Mario 64 for N64 and the vastly under appreciated and underrated Super Mario Sunshine for Gamecube  i felt there was a massive void between my favorites and now. I played galaxy 1 and 2 but didnt feel the same about them. Then i get my hands on Super Mario 3D Land, what a great effort to bring Mario back in a way thats familiar and reminiscent of the classics but with a new school 3D twist. After hours upon hours of playing it i realized that this game has become a top 5 Mario game for me. If your a big fan of the old Mario games like me, you will fall in love with Nintendo all over again with this one. :"
B002I092MM,AGW7BVHXZVW3CLHOV7YGTIQHS6MQ,Five Stars,5,20-Jun-16,"Product arrived on time and works great! No delays, despite my mail being on hold for a bit. Seller is highly recommended."

B002I092MM,AHIHEFVNBELQABAHTAXQ734VCGXA,Decent game but...,3,12-Jul-16,"I'm in the middle of playing this game and it's great like all the other mario games. It's the classic mario world game but just 3D, which makes the game more intricate detailed. It has good visuals and there's a few new things to the game like enemies or power-ups. I like the game, but my only complaint is that it seems that there are far fewer levels for each world than there usually is. There are only about 5 levels per world and there are 8 worlds total. It seems like I'm getting through this game extremely fast and the game itself is not extremely challenging. It takes little effort to pass each level which means it's not a very fun for me. If I could go back, I would not necessarily buy this game again because doesn't live up to the fun that other mario games have given me."
B002I092MM,AHRETP2JHOP67RNGAMEJ2OEA5DOQ,This Mario is so much fun to play,5,22-Jul-16,This Mario is so much fun to play. I can only play this when my kids are sleeping because they claim dibs. You might need to buy more than one copy. LOL

My 8  year old however  is an expert He has been begging me for this game for quite some time. With much excitement Super Mario 3D Land arrived. Our son  is super siked. He has been playing it regularly since it has arrived. The graphics are great, the storyline is is keeping him engaged. He has yet to reach the end yet and that is a good thing. Here is nothing worse when purchasing games for my kids and the solve it it in a matter of days. So far this is a win. Most of our Mario games keep on entertaining him in the long run.This was a great price and arrived promptly. We have Amazon Prime  which I TOTALLY recommend and it arrived in two days."

I found myself getting bored with the game by the third world and ended up beating the game in no time.  It was a little too easy to find the secrets that are usually associated with Mario games and left a lot to be desired."
B002I092MM,AEBN4HSVOQ3FGGG535MZNDCW36RQ,Typical Mario Game,4,4-Nov-16,This gets more like 3.5 stars than 4. Definitely fun to play but it gets boring rather fast. The 3D gets old quick and you will end up playing with the 3D switched off very soon after playing like I did. Typical Mario game. Nothing to rave about but not a bad game either. You know what you are getting when you buy this game.

B002I092MM,AEQP7YGMAG3JXBBLLYY5K62GNAMQ,Lots of fun,5,2-Jun-17,It was a fairly easy game for an experienced Mario player but there is a surprise that I didn't know about that made it a much more challenging game. Maybe it is because I didn't read any reviews or watch anything about the game. But I was really pleased with it. I managed to get it when it was only $25 and the trade-in value was around 12. Now the price went up and the trade-in went down. I will likely keep it because it is one of those games I expect to be a classic.

It is more challenging then Mario Kart, and even some of the other Mario Land games, but still enjoyable. I found it was a little too frustrating for my son, he is very much a perfectionist and doesnt handle dying in the game well. Otherwise, I think this is a good one is pretty cool."

B0050SVGU0,AGC74QDWR2YHPEJ5C3DBTKQBSWSA,Skip this one in the series,1,26-Apr-16,"This shouldn't even be called 'Mario Party'. After 8 games following an identical format (everyone roll, now play a game) they decided to switch it up to basically make it a ""how well can you roll a die"" game. It's very possible to play a round and only play 2 mini games the entire time. The only saving grace is that once you have played every mini game once there is an area to replay any of them, so you can just hang out there for a bit if nothing else. The actual gameplay is nothing more than luck"

B0050SVGU0,AF6WUQJKY3Y6VWXHLVKWBQJBGWGQ,NOT as good as other Mario Parties,2,16-Jul-16,We play this but do not like it as much as the others in the series. I don't like how everyone moves together and you have to land on a mini game spot to play a mini game. so we just play the mini games not the maps
B0050SVGU0,AFIQV76KH74BFJFW6ERERMRMCRKA,Fun and unique,5,20-Jul-16,This game is a bit different from Mario Party 8 but it is super fun. My husband and I play it all the time and it is so much fun. :)

I've played these before, back in the day, and knew they were lots of fun for a group to play. It was very fun, although the maps we have played so far, i wasn't expecting it to be where all four players move along together each step. I liked it better where everyone rolled a dice and moved separately though. It is still fun though, just a personal preference."

B0050SVGU0,AEBKGVWACZEUFLLWZL4B2DW5ASJQ,buy 8 instead.,2,19-Sep-16,"Sadly this is the worst of the mario party games. Must move as a team, game play is structured really differently and it's heavy on little graphic scenes and light on any kind of strategy. 98% luck."

(Remember the N64 original?!) and was ready to relive my...teenage years with the most recent version for Wii.While I wouldn't say I'm disappointed with Mario Party 9, I would go so far to say it's a step back from the previous (Mario Party 8- also played). Here's a breakdown of the changes:- All characters move TOGETHER in a car along the SINGLE DIRECTION board (minus left and right choices.)- A noticeable lack of Wii Remote motion games. A majority have you hold remote sideways for traditional gaming.- Collecting Mini-Stars, instead of coins used to purchase stars.I really like the new mini games, and the mix of strategy, luck, skill and quickness always make it a fun mix. I just wish they had kept the original format with unique board twists and the addition of the new exciting games."

I just started played my old GameCube again (it's amazing that it still works) and just had to try this out for the Wii. Although it was different from some of the other Mario Party games it is still so much fun. It has a slightly high difficulty which makes it even more fun!

However,2,8-Jan-17,"I was very excited about this installment, unfortunately the new system lacks greatly a certain feeling and charm past Mario parties have always had.My biggest complaint is this game requires almost no skill. Almost every aspect is luck based and solo mode is aggravating to say the least, with very few moments of actual enjoyment. However, I'm looking forward to playing with a group of friends instead of a luck based story mode that makes you feel your not doing anything besides hitting a dice block and crossing your fingers."
B0050SVGU0,AFAISNTSWURQ5P4N33F2PICV46PA,Great family game!,5,8-Jan-17,I bought this game for my 6 yr old as a Christmas present and it's quickly become a family favorite. Even my 9 yr old daughter who typically doesn't play Wii games joins in and I play it often with my kids as well.
B0050SVGU0,AFNSRIRCOTRFPFM777SQEZOQUZUA,It's definitely not as fun as Mario Party 8,4,27-Jan-17,"It's definitely not as fun as Mario Party 8. The mini games are cool, but the really lame part is that there's not starts and coins, just ""mini stars."" If you want a faster alternative to the standard Mario Party games, this is it, but if you want the competitiveness and individual strategy, this is lacking in that department. The graphics are great as always and the use of holding the Wii controller sideways for most mini games is much more efficient, but it's missing the pizazz that other versions have."

In the past Mario Party's, each player would roll their own dice to try to get to the star or gain coins for ONLY themselves. Whoever had the most stars/coins at the end of the game, won. In MP9, however, everything is riding in the same car, so when a player rolls the dice, everyone moves forward. This was so boring and completely removes the concept of this game. The minigames were not very fun either. Overall, big big downgrade from previous MP's. We ended up borrowing MP4 and MP6 from our friend to play on GameCube, which was much more fun."

If you love how your choices can effect the story line, this game is for you.  If you love great music in your game, this is the game for you.  However, I subtracted a star because by this point, it should have come with all the DLC.  Instead, if you want those, you have to buy them using Bioware points through their own site.Also, be warned: you WILL become emotionally attached to some (or all) of the squad throughout the series."

It had some unique attributes that were less and less prominent as the series progressed.  There were some story line inconsistencies, but I was at least thankful that the story didn't alter between games, because you are allowed to use your final save from a previous game to influence the new one.  Gun play, story, side activities and quests, voices, graphics....all fantastic.  I wish I'd played this one sooner.  You really get to choose your own adventure with Mass Effect.  EA and Bioware should be proud of their creation, and I'm looking forward to the next installment."

B0050SYBL6,AEI4AIXW5KTN4KVC2LBU2NYFADIA,The greatest maybe ever,5,19-Oct-16,"I was introduced to the world of Mass Effect through my brother when he let me borrow the game series he owned after collecting them all.  To say I absolutely fell in love with the franchise would be the understatement of the year.  Make a long story short, when he wanted his games back I decided I wanted to own them myself so I was ecstatic to find the boxed trilogy.  One of the best purchases I've ever made.  Bear in mind I already purchased all the DLC before I got this trilogy when I was playing the individual games, and it all still plays perfectly with this set too, but don't buy this box set thinking all the DLC is preinstalled, you'll still have to purchase all that yourself."

Great series where morality choices actually follow you if you import a prior character. The combat is interesting, and differs just enough from game to game to make the new abilities fun.

Yes this does play on the Xbox one,  more than that, if you purchased the earlier  DLC for the games they do transfer over as you're using your account and profile from the 360.Replaying these games bring back that first feeling of experiences that came with traveling with the crew of the Normandy: the 1st one had bland exploration, but the 2nd one makes that up with actually making use of your found resources. Straight gaming goodness🤓"

The only downside is that it does not come with all the DLC, which would have made it the definitive box set. What you do get are three well made, excellently voiced, and expertly written sci-fi masterpieces with tons of content by default. The entertainment value of each game individually is worth the price of this entire set.The box is a fold out design held closed by a sleeve. It's slick looking display that has all the shine worthy of the contents it encloses. This is a must have for anyone who likes sci-fi, RPGs, or both. All three games work on Xbox One, so no worries if you don't have a 360."

The game has a lot of great graphics for an Xbox 360 title. In short I recommend the Mass effect trilogy to those who have been wanting to play it. It is also great because of the game being backward compatible for Xbox one."
B0050SYBL6,AFKZERRAY6J7G72TW63JPJY5NULA,Near-Perfect Package of the 3 Trilogy Games!!!,5,11-Feb-18,"I think that this is a near-perfect package of all three Mass Effect games. I have spent an enormous amount of time getting immersed in the world and learning all about the different alien species. I love how the three games are all backward compatible on Xbox One, but I would have loved to see all the DLC for the second and third entries of the series because those are very integral parts of Commander Shepard's storyline. I hope that Bioware decides to do an HD remaster of the trilogy sometime in the near future because I would love to start fresh and play through them all over again!"

It continues to crash at one specific point after playing for maybe 15-20 minutes. Now to be fair i can't say for sure that the problem is the disk itself, for it could be the fact i'm playing it on the XBOX ONE. However that's unlikely . I have not tried the other disks, and i am nervous to do so. I will update the review when i try the other disks and also if the situation gets resolved."

The only downside I would say is that there was a little dirt on the game cartridge itself so I cleaned that off. This did not affect the gameplay and otherwise I was very happy with product.

This may be my favorite in the franchise so far, and definitely a winning addition for those new to the series and die-hard pokefans alike. Great gameplay, new features, and graphics over previous games like the G/S remakes, White 1&2, etc. My favorite part of the game is the new EV training that makes getting into online battles and the competitive scene much easier... and mega evolutions are pretty neat too."

B0053B5RGI,AGEARAXTRH4D3WYF7W5YZBDCC4JQ,not a fan of the new battle graphics,3,2-Mar-16,"I've been playing Pokemon since the original Gold and Silver games came out for the Gameboy Color, so I've been through a fair number of changes to the system already. I'm not a huge fan of this last one though.THe battle graphics are too flashy. They seem like they were designed to hold the attention span of a hyper-active child. It makes it harder to focus on the actual battle/gameplay when the upper screen keeps flashing and moving unnecessarily. That's my only real complaint through. I like the new avatar system, and the better graphics overall. Just not how flashy they are."
B0053B5RGI,AE73CFTUNJCS5R6QVW65KZIBXOHA,Excellent Game,5,4-Mar-16,A cute game that the kids love. The graphics are way better than what they were when Pokemon first came out. Lots of fun new Pokemon for the kids to catch along with some old favorites.

The plot of the game is shallow and dialog will be easily understood by anyone who can read, but if these points are making you consider not buying a pokemon game, pokemon probably wasn't your cup of tea to begin with.

Company was excellent about handling the situation and getting us the game right away.  My son is now playing it and enjoying the game quite a bit.

Still playing the games. Remember when they were on the Nintendo Gameboy series. Graphics have evolved a lot since then. Now were on the 3ds and I can say the Pokemon series is still just as fun to play, with more internal light source than a Gameboy so you can actually play at night or in bed.I refuse to mess up the storyline for you but this game is suitable for kids, adults, and anyone who likes collecting cute monsters."

That's not a big deal I never keep those anyways but on the bag it came in it said new,  as a expected I did buy a game on amazon that was labeled new. So I pop that game in my 3ds and there was a saved game on it where it was played before.

I don't follow pokemon much but really loved it as a kid, had yellow on my gameboy color. Every couple of years or so I pick up the latest game to play and while I enjoy them, I rarely recognize the pokemon and find the story line and new world to be so-so. I really really enjoy this one. Such a fun medley of original pokemon mixed with new generations. I love the Kalos region and all the extras you can do and see. Love how you can dress up and customize your avatar. I also really enjoy that when I'm riding my Lapras in the water, it looks like I'm riding my Lapras in the water, not just a black blob. Oh AND you get two sets of starter pokemon. You get to choose one from the new generation and then about a city further in you get to pick one of the original starters. Very excited to keep playing."

For one, lots of different type and generation Pokemon appear basically as soon as you start the game. Also easy healing access in the beginning, easy explanations, etc. Honestly what Pokemon should have been since at least its GBA daysFor the longest time, Soul Silver was my favorite.

B0053B5RGI,AE7AEIO3P5PB2WFR6LFNUEOPHIAA,Great game with a few things to consider.,5,17-Sep-16,"Very fun game with a story line that keeps you entertained throughout. I will say however that this game felt too easy. I did not feel challenged enough when battling or solving puzzles. Another annoyance I have with this game is the performance at times. I played it with the new 3ds xl and at times the battle screens and the attack animations felt quite laggy during doubles battles or more. Despite that I still consider this game a great addition to the pokemon series, buy it!"

B0053B5RGI,AFRIMLSYB454GBU4M55EU2C4CAFA,The Best Part: Pokemon Diversity,5,9-Jan-17,"I'll be honest: I loved the storyline. And the Pokémon variety is why I love these games. They did magnificently with the diverse populace, especially in adding the new type: fairy. I love fairy. As far as my only dislike/preference is that the conclusion of the campaign was almost too conclusive. The Elite Four were easy, and with the map already practically explored prior to completion, catching the ""rare"" Pokémon was more of a ""go here and throw poke ball = check"". I wish they had invested into more investment as far as what it takes to catch rare Pokémon.Otherwise, this is probably tied for third in my favorite Pokémon games and I still find myself dumping hours into its awesome--even if it is just to raise that ""one"" Pokémon who I know will soon also be replace by the next ""new Pokémon"" to raise. Haha, but so is the life of a Pokégamer xD It also functions as a perfect ""cross/bridge"" to some of the new features brought into Sun and Moon."

The case was good, good condition, I opened it, the cartridge was there, and was also correct. However, when I loaded the cartridge into my 3DS, what loaded... was NOT Pokemon X. No, instead it was a TOTALLY different game. ""Katsuma Unleashed"". I have no clue how THAT came to be, but I wasnt too happy to see that as the game was meant to be a gift on a bit of a time crunch.I hate to leave a bad review on a much beloved Pokemon game, as I adored playing Y, but that was ridiculous and I'd almost say shameful. Buyers beware if you're going for used!"

It's my first time playing pokemon on a Nintendo 3DS, and it's is far superior to the previous pokemon games on the other gameboy systems (gameboy classic and gameboy advance).  It's a dramatic step up from prior generations of pokemon, in part due to the the newer system.  I also like the addition of fairy-type pokemon and mega evolution.  I highly recommend this game."

B0053B5RGI,AHEXL7D5XLQ73TKYOCHRXQQXZMFA,Good Pokemon game but could be better,4,11-Feb-18,"Great Pokemon game compared to older games  however, it is certainly not as good as the Sun/Moon games. The storyline is linear and lacking (much like its predecessors), but the graphics are excellent and it's exactly what you would expect an older Pokemon game to be like. Catch Pokemon, beat the gyms/elite four, fill your Pokedex, and defeat the bad guys (Team Flare).Overall, good game but not nearly as good as Sun/Moon."
B0053B5RGI,AEDDSNU2WRUZ2JQ47YZ6JAQKTXAA,Five Stars,5,17-Feb-18,Super fun to play and I love the selections available for each part of the characters style.
B0053B5RGI,AGKYDBTUPQQSGRXZRNMOW3SBKTHQ,Babies First Pokemon,3,26-Feb-18,"The difficulty curve is extremely slow to build. It hand-holds you near the beginning like you've never played any Pokemon before, and this makes the pace of the storyline suffer a little bit. This is especially frustrating when they introduce you to a centrally located hub city that's heavily cordoned off and restricted until you've done other things, progressed the story further in other areas first. Then out of nowhere, you're minding your own business, exploring an ice cave and WOAH-NELLY, there's that difficulty spike. Soon after, you're facing the Elite Four already, and it was around this part I realized I'm pretty bored with its storyline. There are greater Pokemon games out there like Alpha Sapphire and Moon, but this one excels at easing newcomers into the swing of things. I only hope it ensnares their attention span firmer than it did mine."
B0053B5RGI,AFNXJOHXD7CY2IWXY75MJ2NZ2B4A,A very fun Pokémon game,5,15-Mar-18,This game is very fun to play.The Mega evolution is awesome and it gives a new level of challenge.

B0053BCML6,AHBLZMCG7HHPV4F7V2VWJFMUYXAA,Very fun game,5,25-Jan-16,"A very fin, addictive game. There are so many things to do that I could not put this game down the moment I started playing it. However, once you have completely expanded your house and have created all of the public work projects, the game gets boring.

The characters are so cute and charming, from the way they talk to the way they dress. You start off in a train talking to some stranger(Rover), similar to other animal crossing games. Your answers to Rover's questions correspond to the way you will look in the game. That's pretty cool, but I really wish when we start we are able to customize our character. Don't worry, as the game progresses you will be able to customize your character accordingly."

It's the type of game you can play for years and years, day after day. Since its in real time, the seasons change, and your village will go through holidays just like we do in real life. The amount of things to do, and manage in this game will keep anyone, of any age busy, and entertained.Parents don't have to worry about violence, or the difficulty level here, since there's absolutely no killing, fighting, or frustrating battles or puzzles. It's a great pick up and play game, for all ages!"

It is habit-forming...,5,28-Feb-16,"A superb time-waster for us older folks who don't have the reflexes to deal with the "" hack 'n slash"" games and don't like the violence and gore anyway. Very simple to save progress for those short waits and the console slips easily into a fairly small pocket.  It works just fine on any of the 3DS family but I turn off the 3D effects because, to me, it's just an annoyance. As usual, YMMV."

B0053BCML6,AFGBK2UHVK36MJZYXMV4T2OVED4A,Cute for a toddler not for adults!,3,17-Mar-16,This is a review of the product. Not the company. I am not a fan of this type of game. My wife loves it and had her face glued to the 3ds for almost a week playing this game. I should be giving it more stores as it kept her busy so I can play my games. I'm not though cause the games graphics are terrible and the story line is terrible and maybe cause it is made for kids but really you could probably create a better game using sticks and a skipping stone. Sorry Nintendo nice try but the children this game was designed for probably don't have the dexterity to play the game.that being said the game is cute for a toddler.
B0053BCML6,AHAKBYBZVO4QBQGX6XDY6FMJUS5A,GREAT 3DS game!,5,21-Mar-16,Got this for our 7yr old son after he wanted to play his 9yr old sister's copy of the game.  Well worth the cost as they've both spent many hours exploring and building their repective towns.
B0053BCML6,AGI2DUO3UV2IA4XQEJ5G5G562GMA,It's loads o' fun.,5,21-Mar-16,Always new things to do in-game every day. It's loads o' fun.
B0053BCML6,AEBLOJP3HX4HNOS5L7QULSEH3S4Q,It's good to be the mayor,5,30-Mar-16,"I'd never played an Animal Crossing game, but at the recommendation of my friends and the hype from the online communities absorbed in the series, I gave it a shot. I love it. It's a fairly relaxing life-simulation game with cute characters and no discernible objective or end. The replayability comes from the vast customization choices for the town you lead, your own home, and your avatar. There's an aspect of responsibility in keeping your town clean and pretty as well that definitely adds to the urge to constantly play it, even if only for about ten minutes a day. Nonetheless, you could easily spend several hours running around, changing things, searching for stuff to sell, and talking to the villagers in your town. I've logged more hours into it than any other game on my 3DS. Despite being a life simulator, it makes fairly mundane tasks extremely fun based on its constant reward system. 'S a good game."
B0053BCML6,AFCRPI4I4RABARQZ7AYKQBGU4XKQ,great!,4,30-Mar-16,"Another game I ordered from you, again well sealed, great quality and graphics! Thank you once again!"

I recently purchased my second copy of this game because I enjoy it so much. Even though I've had the game for several years now, I still play almost every day and never get bored of it (and I'm 22)! There is always something to do in the game, whether it's completing your catalog, catching bugs and fish, completing your museum, or designing your town, there is always something to do. I truly love this game and highly recommend it!!"

Like waking up at midnight to go find UFO type addicting. When a game makes me get up at random times of the day to turn it on, it needs to go."

B0053BCML6,AHPGZPWBFNNLODBG2TE3JUJPUZOQ,Very good game.,5,7-Jun-16,I love this game. I bought it over a year ago and am still playing it. Definitely no lack of things to do.
B0053BCML6,AH4N6PSRWDPYZ24UISPXF5FMPBZA,Great game,5,12-Jun-16,"Most addicting game ever! Though it would be cheaper just to go to game stop or walmart. Still, this game is worth every penny."

B0053BCML6,AFBDFXEFJWWCGXTFDYZVDPBCTGAQ,My favorite game ever!,5,18-Jun-16,I love this game! I used to play animal crossing wild world and wanted to give this a shot. There is so much to do at all times! If you're an animal crossing fan or want something to be committed to this is for you!
B0053BCML6,AFEJO3TMLTGOPDAPQ7WDPJ5DPNFQ,Can't Change Skin Color,2,20-Jun-16,"The game itself is fun, but it does have a glaring problem.  You can't change skin color.  If I had known that ahead of time, I wouldn't have purchased the game.  This game lets you decorate your own house and you basically become the mayor and live as him/her.  But you are stuck with pale white skin, unless you tan in the summer, and the tan fades.  It would be nice if there was some variety, and the characters could look like me or my kids.  There is a disconnect there that does not allow me to fully engage with the game, because it is obvious that non-white people were the furthest thing from the game creators' minds when they designed this game."
B0053BCML6,AHGXAKCCXRTN5F62BXE6562QVWXA,It's fun to see them interact while playing,5,20-Jun-16,"My son loves this game. He and my 2 daughters all have it, and play together. It's fun to see them interact while playing."

B0053BCML6,AE5ZNOPM5RO5PRWWUI6ZGD5H7DGA,Love this game,5,8-Jul-16,Love this game.  I am an older player and don't like violent games - this fits me perfectly.  Have been playing for six months and still going strong.  There are always tasks to do and new collectibles to be had.  Would like to see a new addition come out soon!
B0053BCML6,AHCBHJNXRUJSDNPSMP3XVX25Y4IQ,Four Stars,4,10-Jul-16,Well liked but some elements of this game are repetitious/tedious for the player.
B0053BCML6,AFCE73G5B7OTWR7OXRY3WW56VQSQ,Amazing game AC lovers will fall in love with.,5,11-Jul-16,"I have sunk over 200 hours, but probably more like 300 hours into this game. They added so much new content and customizations that it will keep you entertained and hooked forever. The garden ordinance also makes it so your town doesn't get destroyed if you miss a week, meaning you don't have to play it every day like the old ones. Great game for younger children and die hard Animal Crossing lovers. Heck, even new gamers should try it."
B0053BCML6,AHZGJIDULAAVIAY3WAP2IWCUZICQ,Five Stars,5,19-Jul-16,Exactly what my son wanted for his birthday! He has been playing it ever since he got it.
B0053BCML6,AECR7FVTRDIU6QZ2JKZDLBSYHOQQ,... first introduction to the Animal Crossing franchise and I loved it. I have logged over 100 hours in ...,5,23-Jul-16,"This was my first introduction to the Animal Crossing franchise and I loved it. I have logged over 100 hours in the game, abating my worries that I'd get sick of the game after a couple of weeks. As with all my video games, I go through cycles of several months where I don't touch the game followed by periods of frequent playing. I was worried this would interfere with my ability to build a good town, but it hasn't caused any problems. This game involves a lot of repetitive actions, so if that doesn't appeal to you then this isn't the game for you. When deciding to buy this game, I debated between getting it and Tomodachi Life. I later purchased Tomodachi Life as well, and can say that I much prefer Animal Crossing: New Leaf. It's a lot more fun being able to control your own character and shape your own town, rather than just giving gifts to tiny people. Animal  Crossing: New Leaf is a great game and I very much recommend it."
B0053BCML6,AEVHF6IS3VYINJ23UBUX3F3TYJWQ,Really great & simple game,4,7-Aug-16,"Really amazing game when I actually remember to play it, lol. It can get a bit annoying if you forget to play, though, including the villagers hassling you for not being around. :( If you don't mind that, the gameplay is simplistic but fun, including reflex based fishing, diving, and bug catching. There's a lot of hidden things, collectables, and themes to try out that fits almost every style. It's a pretty addictive little game for playing 30~ minutes a day (or longer if you're bug or fish hunting!).There's also a lot of improvements over the other games. Way more unlockables, no need waiting a day to get fossil results, tons of buildings and landscaping, and downloadable designs from QR codes!If you like games with lots of collectables, cute stuff, styles, and characters, it's definitely worth picking up. If you're more like someone who plays the Sims for 3 days straight and puts it down for a month, maybe not."

My fiancee and I are in our 20s ...,5,29-Aug-16,"I got this game as a gift for my fiancee who loves management and sims games.This game is really great. My fiancee and I are in our 20s and we love the game! There's so much to do, from building your town up and making improvements to collecting items to sell to fix your house up. You can talk to the townspeople and try to be the best mayor you can be for them.Whether you're 10, 20 or 50 if you give this game a chance it will eat some serious hours of your life..I love the fact too that the in-game world goes by real world time. Some stores close at 5PM, which means we have to wait until morning to buy items, and some things like certain fish only show up at night. I feel kinda silly waking up and saying to my fiancee first thing in the morning ""Hey babe, the store is open now, you can finally get that door we wanted!"""
B0053BCML6,AHHAIYNLMHUTJGULSZ5Z5KWDTOAA,I'm not going to carry on about what I loved..,4,3-Sep-16,"I'm not going to carry on about what I loved... about this game because everyone else is obviously doing that, so I will tell you what I did not like...I went with 4 stars over 5 because I feel like a lot of the quirkiness and personality has been drained from a lot of the characters. As far as the little gems of dialog that I used to screen shot in Wild World... there's not as much of that. The original Animal Crossing for the Gamecube and Wild World had a much more random and quirky feel to them."

Pop it open once a day, do your dailies, and maybe do some fun little things like fishing or bug hunting for cash. Definitely recommend!"
B0053BCML6,AFG4AAKWGNYO4G6AZBZNAHC2BDJA,"A relaxed, fun game",4,28-Sep-16,"I like this game. I owned ""Wild World"" and played it before this. The graphics are much better than in Wild World and more customization is available, which is fun. The addition of being able to play with friends is a big plus and adds a new aspect of fun to the game. With that being said, it's still a lot like Wild World, which is a bunch of fun, but may be boring to someone who is looking for something new and refreshing. This game is a major time-killer, which is what I wanted it for, and is very laid back and not stressful. It's just relaxing fun. If that sounds up your alley, this is for you."

I've played for maybe 100 hours and it never really gets old. It's fun talking to the other animals in town and acquiring items for your house. It's like The Sims and Harvest Moon if you like those games. It has lovable character and can bring joy to any age group. I highly recommend this game.

It's a very relaxing game just like it's predecessor, there're no major time limits *unless you're returning an item or running an errand for someone*, in fact most of the time you're just required to play once daily. The soundtrack is lovely and Isabelle is so sweet~I love playing it and I wish I could have kept up with it but being on a hectic schedule makes me forget to just check in on everyone."

About 4 more months later and I passed it off to my nephew.He's still playing it frequently.I could get into detail about the game play and such, but really, it can just be summed up simply:A real time game. If today is your birthday, in the game is your birthday. If it's Christmas, it's Christmas in the game too. Etc. You just live a peaceful life cohabitating with animal neighbors. Decorate your house, fish, catch bugs, build friendships, and ultimately, relax. No blood, no gore, no cursing, no violence. And sometimes, it's good to step away from games with all those qualities.Highly recommend."

Cartridge didnt read.Completely my own fault, as I failed to remember that these games are reguon locked and I am an Australian living in Australia with an Australian DS. This happened years ago, but I forgot to write a review... Or was I too ashamed of myself.. Either way, I haven't played the game, but the product itself came in perfect new condition and I'm certain it would have worked had I had the correct console from the correct country to play this US locked game."

I love kids games because they are soothing and adorable. There are very many different things to do in this game but nothing is impossibly difficult and its very personalizable. You can also be creative and get the characters of your town to say certain filthy language for your enjoyment if you are ingenuitive enough.

Finally a use for those amiibo haha!If you have anything in the 3DS family, this game is an absolute must buy. It always feels new and fresh and villagers in your town soon grow on you and feel like true friends.If you're looking for a game with tons of unlockable content, cool sneaky ways to exploit the game's mechanics, a ton of polish, and something to just chill and feel a small sense of accomplishment, then this game is perfect.You can probably live without amiibo festival or happy home designer tho"

Got this as a gift and the kid I gave it to really enjoyed it. I have since bought a copy of it for my younger brother and also played the game myself. There is nostalgia in playing as it brings back memories of the classic Mario Kart games with an updated spin to it. The new levels, characters and arenas are great, this would be a great game for any Mario franchise fan or 3DS owner. I sure enjoyed it."

B0053BCO00,AFOBES6UXZ6MLD2GXYKHOXQCZPFQ,"it's ""just ok""",3,24-Feb-16,"this game is kind of a disappointment for me, as I always play as Waluigi. apparently nintendo did not include him as an unlockable character because 'he is too creepy'... yet they included wario and you can clearly see Waluigi (at least his face) on the pinball looking course. that aside, it's about the same as any other mario kart you could play since the Wii or even gamecube. the gliding feature is interesting, but it really isn't that ""deep"" to really renew the franchise. the 3D gives it an edge over any other mario kart, BUT this can cause problems, as the camera can - at times - blur at in-opportune times (generally when the back ground moves too quickly such as drifting around tight turns, etc)."
B0053BCO00,AGMOHWHKZE2G3ZNBJ6SHENUKCZ7Q,Classic karting,4,27-Feb-16,"I had fun for a few hours with Mario Kart 7, completing all the 150cc cups and almost all the mirror cups. I really love that they included classic levels from past Mario Kart games. Not my favorite 3DS game and it didnt capture me like Super Circuit did on GBA, but then again that might just be the nostalgia goggles."

Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing were my favorite games on that system.  Unfortunately, I did outgrow video games (for the most part).  I bought a Nintendo 3DS largely for the fact that lot of the Nintendo 64 games were coming out on this system.  Impressive that these games are now portable."

Was able to give her this game for almost 10$ cheaper than the store. I ended up playing it more than she did and it is fantastic. It's been a while since I have played a hand held system and this game was flawless and brought me back to my childhood with gameboys. Graphics are as good as the home system. Thanks Nintendo you are the best! Also if you can release 8 for the 3DS that would be great!

My son is a HUGE Mario Kart fan, and just received a 2ds for his birthday. So this game seemed like the perfect gift for him. We already have Mario Kart 8 at home, and I was worried that this was going to be too similar to that and not provide enough fun for my son. Boy, was I wrong. There are a few different levels, different karts, and different challenges to overcome in this game. If you are a Mario Kart fan and own a 2ds or a 3ds, I would highly recommend this game."

It introduces a fun little glide gimmick, has a good variety of levels, just like Mario Kart Wii before it, and an decent variety of characters, but a number of them have to be unlocked by completing certain cups on the highest difficulty (which is no easy feat unless you are really good at racing games). The one major problem I have with this game is the spiny shell, which I think overstayed its welcome after the last game. The male Mii character voice they chose is also really annoying, it literally sounds like baby noises."

It struck a great balance between casual players and hardcore players, and I love this title for it. Mario Kart 8 went overboard with the casual experience, alienating a lot of competitive players with its worsened drifting mechanics. Nintendo representatives, if you're reading this, I implore you to bring the next Mario Kart closer to this. Casual AND hardcore gamers can both enjoy a balanced engine like this."

It was developed by Obsidian, not Bethesda, so that's why it's got a subtitle and not a number (like Fallout 3, Fallout 4)  however, that doesn't mean it falls short of the fun and experiences you've come to expect from Fallout games.I also liked the setting of this one.  It was a lot of fun to check out the post-apocalyptic version of Las Vegas.As always there's TONS of content in a gigantic open-world map.  You're free to choose to help people (or not), and there's no lack of challenge.If you are at all a fan of Fallout, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  It is a lot of fun."

You get all the DLC's and the game is challenging and very engrossing.  The $12.99 price is way beyond reasonable.  The only negative aspect is the running around back and forth with some of the quests, but that's a part of what role playing games are about"

I spent hundreds of hours exploring this vegas wasteland and had very little issues with the game. Of course, there's always your random bugs in a game of this scope so be sure to save a ton.The story was pretty slick, and there's many paths you can choose to go down.Hundreds of weapons, weapon mods, armors, etc to customize your character. VATS still sucks, I barely use it. I recommend the hardest setting once you get a little ways into the game. Definitely raises the challenge and makes you collect food and water.Expansions aren't the greatest but to me, they were much better than the ones in Fallout 3."

It was a great price and I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I was right!  This game is really great.  It took me a little while to figure out exactly what I was doing, but it's really a great game once I got the hang of it.  It's not my very favorite game - that'd be Skyrim - but it's a very nice addition to my game selections and I am so glad I gave it a try.The DLC all being included was especially nice!

Still though, I feel that Fallout 4 lacked the story quality that Fallout New Vegas had. The fact that if you get the ""Fallout: NV Ultimate Edition"" you get the base game AND all of the Downloadable Content is crazy.If you are considering buying Fallout New Vegas make sure to purchase the ultimate edition, as you will want the DLC's accompanying stories as well!"

I had pretty much exhausted all of the story line options in Fallout 3, but I wasn't ready to move away from the Fallout franchise. I have read a lot of reviews where it seemed that people either really liked Fallout 3 OR Fallout: New Vegas, so I was nervous that I wouldn't enjoy this game as much, but so far it is great. The game is fully immersive, and while I've only been able to explore a portion of the game environment so far, it seems vast and detailed. The story line picks up pretty quickly. I'm looking forward to spending more time playing."

All the normal fallout stuff is here so if you're a big fan of fallout you will like this game, probably a lot more than me."
B0065NP6NC,AHO4SRLSR7FTU3BPIMLPVKEOJB5A,10-Oct,5,29-May-17,Absolutely perfect game. The delivery was fast and the package was nice and sturdy. Didn't have a single issue.
B0065NP6NC,AHLSL3NISI3634BQRVXYOQ5JYA5A,Beware of losing a good portion of your life to the game,5,1-Jun-17,"Delivered fast. Game is great. Not kid-friendly by any means. (frequent cursing, intense gore, prostitution, drug use, etc.) After you have been playing for awhile (around 60 hours for me), the game may freeze on you on occasion. It can be very frustrating, but the occurrences are far enough between each other that I can forgive the nuisance."
B0065NP6NC,AF56ZYPMQAR5JBMPKQUGZ3Z3SXWA,Amazing value,5,16-Jun-17,Amazing value you not only get the entire core game but also all the DLCs. This game has great story telling and world building far superior to Fallout 3 and 4. You can sink hours into this game with multiple different characters and play styles.
B0065NP6NC,AEA7SZ6L7BWXSZNRMU4NJL6BYEZA,Excellent value!,5,6-Jul-17,This game is rated highly for a reason. 80+ hours  of gameplay easily and the ultimate gives you some very solid dog to extend play time even further. I couldn't recommend it enough. Confirmed to work with xbox one.

B0065NP6NC,AEKC27SCCBL3MGIYODNWBSV4OWBA,Faster on xb1,5,9-Jul-17,Runs great on Xbox one s. I have an external hard drive with USB 3.0 and the load speeds are dramatically improved. That's the biggest improvement with the backwards compatibility. Everything from 360 runs so much faster on the xb1.

Seller shipped fast and was as described.  Problem isn't with the seller, just the game itself."

B0065NP6NC,AGVAREXEIO5FUIC5JBGVSVQCTBCA,Wonderful experience!,5,2-Aug-17,"Excellent condition, brand new as promised. Super fast delivery. Thank you!"
B0065NP6NC,AGDLIPCZRAV74SYQPUFN7GOPMOAA,glad I waited so long to pick this up,5,4-Aug-17,Comes with a redesigned case that states it's compatible with both 360 and Xbox one. All addons and the game for one low price. glad I waited so long to pick this up. Amazing value for money
B0065NP6NC,AE6IIMJURAUZKCHL7ZZAOZL7HOSA,My favorite game.,5,7-Aug-17,"The package came in perfect condition, everything was there, there's really nothing more I could ask for."
B0065NP6NC,AHOAABOEIRPMHP4KTH4TSSUDO2GQ,"Great game, but a little heads up",5,10-Aug-17,"It's a perfect RPG game and there isn't anything that beats it, but once you try to install it make sure the 1st and 2nd disc are installed. After, you have to play using disc 2 if you want all the dlcs. Many people have been confused about that."
B0065NP6NC,AGTXRC7ZGXXTZJ5ZI64WLP346RWQ,"The game itself is excellent, especially if you're a big fan of the ...",5,21-Aug-17,"Bought this for a friend way back then, and it arrived in a timely fashion (was a gift from me sent to a distant city). The game itself is excellent, especially if you're a big fan of the older Fallouts (same creators as Fallout 2), because it respects canon and even progresses it. The closest we'll get to a faithful sequel. All DLC included will only add more to this game's awesomeness (special mentions go to Lonesome Road and Dead Money, for me. Old World Blues is also very popular)."
B0065NP6NC,AEM4JPSX7LOQN3IW4BTW73AAURMQ,One of the best FO game!,5,13-Sep-17,"One of the best Fallout game. Gambling is so fun in here and when you mix that up with a post apocalyptic thrill to it, WOW."
B0065NP6NC,AEMSFILPDFPC37P6VJZ7O5R3EA3Q,Looks great,5,22-Sep-17,I didn’t want to knock off a star just because the second disk came with a TINY scratch. Disk one(the game) had zero scratches/marks. I absolutely love this game and recommend it to everyone. The packs took ~15 mins to install
B0065NP6NC,AFC5BJHJRXAJRDIUZDOQDPBENS5Q,Five Stars,5,23-Sep-17,this game was almost to much fun it will suck you in get ready for sore thumbs.

B0065NP6NC,AFXJ5BVEJ5V6LA5M43D4AKNM7EEA,Very nice,5,1-Oct-17,Less boring and repetitive than Fallout 3 and more RPG feeling than Fallout 4.
B0065NP6NC,AEOY5NJUZB773RAJV2OES57OSCLQ,Bugs ruined an otherwise exceptional game.,2,24-Oct-17,"I really wanted to like this game. I played and enjoyed Fallout 3, and I like this genre of games in general. However, the constant bugs ruined this game. I walk through a doorway, and my Xbox freezes. I attempt to buy an item, and my Xbox freezes, I drink from a water fountain, and my Xbox freezes. I ended up not even finishing the game because I got tired of getting up, restarting my Xbox, loading the last save, and trying again."
B0065NP6NC,AHY3BGFNLRY4UFMKJHBMUIJCTUCQ,war...war sometimes changes.,4,24-Oct-17,"its a good game, i bought it to play on My xbox one, the game stands to the test of time pretty good with some additional challenges that fallout 4 removed."
B0065NP6NC,AG3TR5RZHOA772BNWFO73PK4EMMQ,Full ultimate edition game,5,26-Oct-17,Came in on time with all dlc two disc set. Brand new in packaging. Not sure how it's so cheap but definitely better than gamestop.
B0065NP6NC,AE3VO7NEACNHCTPTBHGSF6263Q5A,Another win for Bethesda,4,11-Nov-17,"The game, story line, and weapons are absolutely amazing. The only complaint i have is that there's quite a few glitches that haven't been patched. I assume it's because they moved on to 3 & 4. Regardless, it's a great game."
B0065NP6NC,AETD4I6YSSBUPY57F6P4NFPILPNQ,Great Game!!,5,13-Nov-17,Excellent game.  Love the feel of the in-game environments.  I have played Fallout 3 & 4.  This one is still a tad bit different and provides a different yat very familiar experience.  Great Game!!
B0065NP6NC,AGCI34RHDROXV53FOKPC3SIAFQAA,Lots of content for such a low price,5,29-Nov-17,"Great game, although a bit buggy. Doc's work flawlessly. Lots of content and replayablity for its price. Very pleased."

I bought it after playing Fallout 3 and loving the world/story, and this one was even better. You can easily get over 100 hours of gameplay with all the quests and the DLC are some of the best I’ve played. I don’t enough good things to say about the writing in this game.The only bad thing is that this game is notoriously buggy  it freezes often, autosaves corrupt, infinite loading screens, etc., so make sure you save often. It runs much, much better with far fewer freezes on xbox one however.I would be so happy if this game ever got remastered, it definitely deserves to be."

B0065NP6NC,AHNEHQTY3L7MLMWM2HME7L2GSYBQ,The story line is good in this game,3,17-Jan-18,"I bought this eight years after the release, therefore my opinion is a bit skewed. The story line is good in this game, but the graphics and fighting leave something to be desired. I have played Skyrim before this, which I think fixes most of the issues that I find unappealing with this game. All in all, I'd give this game a passing grade, but just barely."
B0065NP6NC,AHI4COINH4ZGHIJUEJSFP4FLUHJQ,You and Lady Luck. Karma is watching.,5,20-Jan-18,My nostalgia when I played on a personal computer made me buy it. It has glitches like sunny finger stretching to hell becoming skin claws. Gun shots and voice loud enough to make me thing about shooting or talking. This game taught us the fun of actual iron sight aiming.  I recommend this if you haven't met Cassidy Rose or Veronica.
B0065NP6NC,AGNSE3S6I35RJSKXTCU2WPSBDIJQ,Quite possibly one of the greatest human achievements of all time,5,28-Jan-18,"7 years later this game still holds up, the greatest Fallout and one of the most interesting and open ended experiences you'll ever find. It's a shame it will probably not get sequel or atleast a remaster, but it's still stands out as a pinnacle of what gaming can be."
B0065NP6NC,AH6BOFZYKGXCS4X3QQLBITRUULJQ,Both my son and I love this game,5,19-Feb-18,Both my son and I love this game. Its one of my favorites because there are so many hours of game play!
B0065NP6NC,AGMBB27GUFIMKROR6WOLUEC5T3MQ,Great game,5,22-Feb-18,"A wonderful game, and as great as it's predecessor, Fallout 3. Has all the add-ons with it for a good price. If you want to game on a budget, this the game because you can play for countless hours and still be discovering new things to do,"
B0065NP6NC,AHLU2DNYWMSL245EEQYDMJL3YR5Q,May be the best Fallout game to date!,5,2-Mar-18,"If you liked Fallout 3 you'll love this! Great story that you get to mold depending on how you want to play. Multiple replays just to check out other endings. One of the few games I've played over and over. Try it, you'll like it!"
B0065NP6NC,AFVUDNBTUQPAGUPZKOWTWJIQCY3Q,One of the greatest games of all time,5,7-Mar-18,One of the greatest games of all time. Why are you still reading this review? Buy it and see if the game really was fixed from the start!

Amazing how the graphics since fallout 3 though not the absolute best still after nearly 10 years give latest games originally for xbox one a run for their money.

Not worth it.
B0065NP6NC,AGLUWIYFI6QPQKD3UFMEXBT26U5Q,Best of the Fallout Series,5,14-Apr-18,"Great game, comes with all the DLCs. Just a heads up to activate the DLC on the Xbox one (XB1) you need to download them from the Microsoft store. do NOT pay for them in the store. If you have disk 2 inserted into your XB1 than a download option should appear in the store."
B0065NP6NC,AFLXVBOO2Z7CKB2JD53JZBVERB3A,The best game I have ever played,5,5-May-18,"I wasn’t much of a gamer growing up since my parents discouraged it and I never got to play all these games my friends were playing as they came out. Now as an adult I decided I wanted to try to see if I could recapture that part of my childhood I always wanted but never got to experience. This was the first game I played, and having played many more since then, I can honestly say I’m sad that it took me 25 years to play it and very happy that my first console game was this awesome."
B0065NP6NC,AEEQ7GUXKAJSMKGNTJF37M6SRZVA,love the game and series,5,12-May-18,"When I saw this game was backwards compatible for the Xbox one s, went online right away and got it, love the game and series, works perfectly"

B0065NP6NC,AFIYRWJDMNJR3VHM77MNWLRGITIQ,"It's fine, but not as good as Fallout 3",3,15-Jul-18,"I bought this game after reading online about how much better it is than Fallout 3. I disagree- I think Fallout 3 is still better, but this game is kind of fun in its own right. New stories and locations to explore are always welcome. I can't get into the game like I could with FO3- the story just doesn't grab me."
B0065NP6NC,AFGDLKO4QRHFXSILWNTBW5PXLI4Q,"Xbox One, not 360",5,19-Jul-18,"This is my all time favorite game of the Fallout storyline and I needed a replacement since I’d given mine to a new vault dweller recruit. I was expecting a copy for Xbox 360, but it came as a Xbox one reprint instead (which I don’t mind one bit). It comes with all the DLCs as shown."
B0065NP6NC,AF77A7OVOSJSSFX6A2BTCELQGEPQ,Surprised,5,31-Jul-18,Didn’t know this version was for the Xbox one and Xbox 360.

B0065NP6NC,AHZLW6SOXJKAFDVOZJ7667SIZGOA,For my purposes,5,30-Aug-18,It was cheaper to buy the game then pay to get the DLC after I lost my hard drive.

I've tried pretty much all of the advice online for every glitch, but this thing sucks! The game would be great - if I could play it. I am wondering if this is a pirated disk? I will be sending it back for a refund."
B0065NP6NC,AFEMU4XBOGS6B5EU5VTW42AFB3LA,Just as described?,5,21-Sep-18,"Ordered 360 because I did not see an option for XBone, but definitely got XBone copy, so... A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one"

Anytime I have expressed anything negative toward Amazon in reviews, they will not post them.  They claim bad words or spam....I will leave my review at this - which is pure fact, not spam and no bad words.I ordered this game based on the picture and that is appeared to be an unopened American version.  I received a UAE copy.  I know this because it has a big stamp on the front of the game box that says UAE/Malaysian copy.  Pretty straight forward."
B006QRNKOO,AGWKBXAGQVUHGJ5FTAH2CCRY3Z6Q,UAE Copy.,4,27-Feb-16,I got a UAE/ Malaysia copy with my order too. As far as I know it's still a U.S. region disc and it plays just fine in my Wii. The game is in english. A little misleading with the product image but I can live with it.

Skyward Sword is a great mix of Twilight Princess and Windwaker. I really enjoy the motion controls on this one. You really feel like you are sword fighting your opponents. This game came wrapped and sealed brand new. I couldn't be more pleased. A must have for any Zelda fan. Enjoy!!
B006QRNKOO,AHE3HLD4SKXQ6MRJW2WUJW4JTTFA,Series Topper,5,15-Jun-16,Perfect condition out of the box and my girlfriend loved it. It is a fun puzzle and gaming experience that was innovated ahead of its time.

Just be prepared to be annoyed a bit.Twilight Princess and Wind Waker were both better games.

However, unless you're putting this game in a display case it really doesn't make a difference.  It looks nearly identical to the US version besides for the different country sticker on the front and the text on the back being in 3 languages.  I've researched it a bunch before I tore the plastic off to make sure i wasn't getting screwed.  It is a legit copy, not a pirated rip off.  I tried it in my Wii and Wii U (both consoles were purchased new in the US) and it plays just fine.  The only difference is a few minuscule variations within the in game text. Unless you compare the text side by side though you will not notice. The game came out in 2011....They aren't making new US discs anymore.  I'd much rather have this than a used copy, which still costs $40 and that's probably going to have some scratches on it. Buy it, play it, enjoy it."

Game is a UAE Saudi Arabia/Malaysia/Singapore version, not a US version  still worked on a US Wii and played in English with no weird translation issues.Skyward Sword's story is meant to be the first in the story line chronology of the Legend of Zelda- the pair that started the legacy. There are a lot of cut scenes, which is to be expected when you have a lot of story to tell. The Wii Motion plus controls are very finicky,  so be prepared to have it not register your swings correctly."

The controls will take some time getting used to, but eventually it will become second nature. The saving system is different in that the game uses save points. At first I didn't like this idea, but the save points were plentiful, so I never found myself playing longer than I wanted looking for a save point.FYI, this game will likely be the Singapore, UAE, and Malaysia version not the US version. This game WILL be 100% English in game and WILL work on a US Wii without any problems. The sole difference is that the cover will have a seal that says Singapore, UAE, and Malaysia. Everything else is identical. I doubt you'd be able to find a brand new US version at this price, so don't flip out and instead enjoy."

Whenever I think of it, I remember nothing but happy and awesome memories from playing in my teen years, but when you actually play it... there's just so... many... horrible things that annoy me to death. Everyone is constantly talking to you, making sure you're on the correct path and whatnot, making sure that EVERYTHING is explained to you. The adventure that is there IS an adventure, but all of Link's buddies are the ones who get to go on it. I guess, in short, it's an extremely shallow game, but this is the best that shallow can be. There are many many awesome puzzles, moments, items, combats, etc., and I personally love the motion controls (for like 95% of the game) despite the fact that I usually prefer not to use them. And of course, the story isn't monumental but is probably the best I've seen come straight from Nintendo in recent years..."

If you aren't put off by the cutesy designs and weaboo mentality then this is definitely a game worth checking out. Underneath the overacting and round about dialogue hides a very deep story filled with mystery, comedy, romance, horror and friendship, and an incredibly addicting game play style. Like I said, even with all the amazing reviews and good points about the game, it is still very much a VERY Japanese game, and plays out like a typical high school comedy action anime, so if you can't stomach that sort of thing, all the play throughs in the world won't make this series any more tolerable.

B007W8S2MG,AGDVRPFBPZWCADJYES3U3I43IT6Q,A must-play,5,17-May-16,"One of the best games of all time! After the first hour or two not knowing if this game was going to be for me, I fell in love and ended up spending around 90 hours playing."
B007W8S2MG,AGIYHYAHTQ6MRQIQYFZDCJUWQPQQ,My favorite game ever,5,29-May-16,"My favorite game ever. Even if you already played the PS2, this game is amazing, you will not regret. And for those who never played Persona4 before, well, Enjoy the ride.PD. I played in a PS TV, since I don't have a PS Vita."
B007W8S2MG,AEKGX65G2L2C45DDJSH6P5EPKPWQ,"Not Just a Great Vita Game, but Great on Any Console",5,2-Jun-16,"Ive never been a huge fan of JRPGs, but I have been blown away by this game. The story, character depth, gameplay, and music are awesome. I cant believe the developers were able to cram so much into a vita game. This game alone justifies owning a Vita. It took me a while to figure out how everything with the Personas worked and almost accidentally got rid of some of the high level ones, but eventually got it sorted. As a hobbyist game developer, this is the sort of game Im always striving to make."
B007W8S2MG,AHHS46LGDXNDAKULSOAIV45CTUUQ,The definitive P4,5,2-Jun-16,"Let's face it ... the PS2 is pretty oldschool right about now.And while the Vita may be on its last legs, it's still an amazing and ridiculously underrated handheld.P4 Golden takes the original game and adds an additional scenario, as well as some new music and other assets. Beyond that, it's Persona 4, which is one of the best RPGs of yester-decade.Absolutely worth it."

It is an incredibly visualizing game that will retain in your memory, like Zelda: TOoT.Stunning graphics. Breath-taking story. Immersive game play. If you don't even own a PlayStation Vita you should consider purchasing one just to play this game!"
B007W8S2MG,AFWH7IOD6GBH2SOR4PXYMRP4HBWQ,Your social life will slowly disappear,5,5-Jul-16,"Just so you know this game should not be rated M in fact I really think it could be something like E 10 and up. This is one of my favorite games off all time and I used to play it for hours on my ps2. I saw that this game was remastered for the ps Vita and I went out and got a ps Vita just so I could play this beautiful game. I have over 327 hours of gameplay and will continue to play it some more. I didn't even mean to play it this much it just happened but be careful, as soon as you play this game your social life will slowly disappear."
B007W8S2MG,AG6HFVFDSBNNBSKSEH5RU64A4B7A,Atlas just earned more fan,5,5-Jul-16,"I hate final fantasy because of the turn-based system (I bought the first one in my iPad for $15.99 and totally regret it). I bought this game without realizing that is also a turn based game until I firing it up, but oh my how did I not regret it! The plot and the fighting systems they made are awesome! I guess this turn asked game is the only exception one for me."
B007W8S2MG,AGXFZOXBQKO6DGTXGDJDUCHLOKVA,BEST GAME ON VITA,5,13-Jul-16,"I bought a vita last year and this game was highly recommended but I didn't have a clue what this game was. Once I started I couldn't put my vita down,it hooked me as I love rpg and especially well written characters. I'm in love with this game and franchise (I went played Persona 3 and 2, the animation TV series). I'm eagerly waiting on Persona 5 and while I wait I keep revisiting this one to make the wait a bit easier."

B007W8S2MG,AFAJVBFCCEGV6KWZLAY5QZUUO6CQ,Hyperbolic Reviews need to be tempered by objectivity,2,21-Sep-16,"This was my first PS Vita game. I wrote a critical review because it was so boring, then was buried by intolerant fanboys/girls and removed it. Most of the reviews are hyperbolic. Hey, it's fun to like what other people like, it's human nature. But objectively, the music gets on your nerves within an hour, the dungeons are like ""Betrayal at Krondor"" level of sophistication, and I'm sorry to say, but there was just too much cultural difference between the storyline and my own experiences growing up. This made it difficult to care about the characters and constantly wonder what on earth was going on. Some of the characters I found myself rolling my eyes at so frequently I had to turn the game off. I can completely see this game being amazing for people who've found themselves drawn toward JRPGs, but it simply doesn't compare (IMO) to other RPGs (Final Fantasy, Chronotrigger, etc.) I'm really disappointed in Vita's selection of games, especially if this is the most popular."
B007W8S2MG,AGMBDDQN4WA72YD7MIPL4XE3ML2A,The best game for me in the last five years,5,25-Sep-16,"Before I played the game starting in 2015, I know it has received a lot of acclaims. But I didn't took these good reviews seriously, because I think it is more personal experience. But when I actually play it this far (one year and a half), I totally fall in love with the game. It is truly a masterpiece! And it is the best JRPG that I've ever played and also the best game for me in the last five years. The storyline, characters, and music are almost perfectly good. I bought a PS TV just for playing this game and it really worth it. Strongly recommend it to everyone who wants to play the best JRPG."
B007W8S2MG,AF4EQK2CFVSDIBFLSSLKBLMP5C3Q,"If you own a PS Vita, you HAVE TO have this game",5,25-Sep-16,"This was the first game I bought for my PS Vita, and this has been one of my favorite games I've ever played. All of the characters have life and are provided with diverse characteristics and backstories, and the game allows you to formulate your own unique gaming experience.I can go on forever about how great this game is. Take my word for it, this game is worth every penny and will keep you happy and entertained for hours."

B007W8S2MG,AGIOLNRBCRDELOGMEAKSEQGT6RBA,Golden,5,27-Sep-16,"I'm really new with the Persona universe. I've heard good things about this and I was recommended to try it because I love JRPG games. When I first tried the game, I was hooked. I couldn't stop playing this game. The game is awesome. The graphics, the music, the battle system, the gameplay and the story. Everything about this game is perfect. If you are a JRPG fan like me, I would definitely check this game out. I have a blast playing this game. I've probably spend over 50+ hours of playing the game. It's just that good. I can't stress enough to recommend this game and definitely a must have title for the PSVita. Two Thumbs Up"
B007W8S2MG,AHDBPP57A64Z73BQXLMCXBVZOFWQ,Persona!!,5,25-Oct-16,"I bought a PS Vita for a road trip this summer, and this was my first game for the platform. I was a little skeptical, I've never been one for turn based combat, but the reviews were so great I gave it a chance. THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! The story, the music, the dialogue, the gameplay. And there is definitely replay value. If you own a PS Vita-you need to buy this game."

B007W8S2MG,AGLRKRF5CC57TL4NZMTHGF3PYVPA,Masterpiece,5,7-Dec-16,Came in great. The game itself is fantastic. Likeable characters and even though I'm only at Rise's dungeon but I'm positive it won't drop down in quality.
B007W8S2MG,AEYDJ7BMONKGIYYQXGYMER5HIQJA,Persona strikes again,5,14-Dec-16,"I ordered this alongside 4 other Ps Vita games and it arrived first so I had the chance to envelope myself in the game while I waited for the rest and I nearly forgot about the other ones due to how stellar this game is! I thoroughly enjoyed Persona 3 on my PSP and could not wait to try Persona 4 on my Vita  I definitely was not disappointed. The opening song, like all Persona games, is so good that I rarely skip it and end up trying to sing along even though i'm a terrible singer. The game play itself is similar to Persona and is a turn based fighting game, but the story is very captivating and the characters are pretty  well done. I may not have finished it yet but I'll update when I do~"
B007W8S2MG,AH7IUFO4KANFJBSIQU64VWHG7DRA,Three Stars,3,14-Dec-16,Overrated. Interesting concept but gets repetitive. I suppose JRPGs are not my cup of tea.

Get this game.",5,10-Jan-17,"At first I didn't really know what I was getting myself in to. As my first persona game, I knew alittle of the game and what it contained. But after playing it for awhile and when the story really started to kick in. Oh man, this game is probably one of the best on any handheld. period."

B007W8S2MG,AF3KMX4WD6JGMJY4VJ2IOBXGYOFA,I wish they made this version available to more than a vita,5,31-Jan-17,"It's Persona, if you haven't played it you should try one. All of the stories are really good if you like a little bit of Japanese culture. Gameplay is a step forward and a step back in someways. They've made it easier and more accessible by eliminating some RNG elements but lost some of the cool things that were in Persona 3 regarding dungeon's. The happy mood of this series is great and I believe that there is values in this game that describes life from different perspectives if you want to look deeply. Play this game and then play persona 5 where they really stepped up the style."
B007W8S2MG,AHHMCH6G2THDJNW3POYOYNZSP5TA,I see why a lot of people like it. I like the story,5,6-Feb-17,"I've never played a persona game and I'm not a hardcore gamer, so I thought maybe this wouldn't be for me or it would be too hard.

B007W8S2MG,AEF755POYMMDOFY23SOF7OKDLBDA,The definitive Persona.,5,21-Jun-17,"Persona 4 perfects on the anime themed high school sim / dungeon crawling formula most notably laid down in Persona 3. Where Persona 4 succeeds is in presenting a murder mystery with a whole lotta heart and an infectious upbeat feeling that makes the highs high and the lows low. It's hard not to feel for the various characters as you become intimate with their hopes, dreams and darkest secrets. Persona 4 asks if you can face your inner demons at one moment then presents a heart wrenching dilemma between hanging out with your friends or going out for ramen.You'll easily lose yourself in 100+ hours of solid JRPG complete with a bonus dungeon, some new endings and easily the most wholesome entry in the Persona series to date."
B007W8S2MG,AFLTAOVT344VDOOWYXVCIP3XVZ7Q,It consumed me,5,13-Jul-17,"As a working adult, this game brought the kid out in me again. Playing all night, going to work tired and ignoring home chores just to finish this game."

I got 60 hours out of the game before I got bored, and I only got about 30% of the trophies. Plenty to do, great replayability (and a New Game + mode), great combat, and interesting characters/stories."

Marie may not have been the best character, but I feel that her addition to the game was still done in good taste.

You get 2 additional social links,5,2-Oct-17,"Persona 4 Golden is one of those games that is so hard to explain to people other than just saying ""play it and you'll understand"".I am (now) a big fan of the Persona series and P4G has a very special place in my heart. Compared to the original it has more content and better graphics. You get 2 additional social links, another month of gameplay and an additional epilogue. I'm sure there's more than I'm missing as well.This is a top-tier JRPG with a rich story and a wonderful group of characters. The character development through the social links gives you an in-depth understanding of everyone's true feelings regarding themselves and you as the protagonist.Thanks to P4G we also have 2 fun and hilarious spin-off games that are also well worth your time and money. I'd also suggest watching the original anime (not Golden anime) to immerse yourself further in the story.I really cannot begin to describe my love for Persona 4 but I can tell you it is everything a JRPG lover wants and more."

I’m about 30 hours in and I’m having an amazing time. Now, I need to ask: Why am I just getting to this?"

B007W8S2MG,AHTB2RVY35A5JSOFIS7J6JB7X2RQ,Easily became one of my favorite games on the Vita,5,14-May-18,Easily became one of my favorite games on the Vita. I have an easy 80+ hours into it. Definitely worth the money.
B007W8S2MG,AHC26U4CYGOOLXS2B4AHESPGO5WA,Love this game,5,25-May-18,"Love this game I had been wanting to get it for a while and I was super excited to play. The story is wonderful as all Persona games are, and the art is beautiful  so are the graphics. The battle portions are fun even though they can be hard. Grinding for levels doesnt feel like a chore. The rain function for rescue is interesting and a new concept for me. The only thing I would have to complain about is the lack of SP items. It frustrates me to high heaven trying to find some. I heard that later on in the game it wont be an issue though"
B007W8S2MG,AEMQ4GCFZXV7PHORKS6ULBDFUGKA,Five Stars,5,27-May-18,"Love the game play and the story, one of the biggest reasons I bought a Vita last year."

B007W8S2MG,AG6AFVM6G6SSPFAGJMWC5VILTFQQ,Five Stars,5,26-Jul-18,Fantastic game I would reccomend to anyone who loved persona 5 or is into story driven RPG's
B007W8S2MG,AGOOGCENNWMZMWUAALBLAF5MMOUQ,Fantastic RPG,4,4-Sep-18,"Coming off the exciting adventure of Persona 5, I decided to pick up this title, Persona 4 Golden. Its one of the best rpgs, and for a reason. most RPGs with turn-based combat are often tedious due to how they always require the player to use the same tactics and redundantly engage in encounters, often out of their ability to predict, Persona 4 Golden however, allows your combat to evolve, and gives breathers with its visual novel identity, having a social system with great characters that are timeless and loveable. It does familiars better than pokemon ever did, having a compendium and the ability to customize your personas much more. The combat can get a bit repetitive, even with breaks, but they are still enjoyable. The story is great, having a mystery element that makes the player think. Its just a great game, play it. I don't think the game is as good as Persona 5 due to the lesser immersion, style, lore, and combat depth, but its still an amazing game."
B007W8S2MG,AHPWRW74TZGGVOWKINMVKFECNBXQ,Fun and colorful.. great for those new to the Vita and persona,5,9-Sep-18,My first Vita game so far.. and I think it's really funny! The art is so colorful.
B007W8S2MG,AFSGJ65TLHINWCQL7EPHOPE6775A,because I have a lot of love for the original P4 game,5,5-Oct-18,"I went through the effort of getting a PS Vita almost solely for the sake of playing this game, because I have a lot of love for the original P4 game, and for P3P before it, and I've got to say it was absolutely worth it. This game comes with LOADS more content, not just in terms of the extra months of gameplay you get at the end, but all the new characters, features, and mini cutscenes you get right from the beginning! If you like P4, this game is absolutely worth buying for the extra content, even if you've played through P4 before, as I have."
